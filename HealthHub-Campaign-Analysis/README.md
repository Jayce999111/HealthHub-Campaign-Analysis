### Sales Trends:

- The company's sales peaked in 2021 with **1,541,000 orders**, totaling **$7,560,146** in yearly revenue. This peak aligns with the surge in healthcare demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumer behavior shifted with more people seeking healthcare services and products online.
- Starting in the first quarter of 2023, the average order value (AOV) dropped year-over-year for 24 consecutive months, marking a **21% decrease** compared to the previous year’s AOV.
- Despite this decline in AOV, both signups and revenue have increased as more customers are joining campaigns. Though customers are opting for lower-priced campaigns more frequently, the increased transaction volume pushed the company’s revenue to an all-time high of **$8,320,576**.
- A significant drop in AOV was also observed in early 2020, largely due to the lower-cost **COVID-19 Vaccination Drive** campaign, which contributed to the overall decrease.
